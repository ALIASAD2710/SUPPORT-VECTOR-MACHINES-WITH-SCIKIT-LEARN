# SUPPORT-VECTOR-MACHINES-WITH-SCIKIT-LEARN
The core idea of SVM was to find a maximum marginal hyperplane (MMH) that best divides the dataset into classes.  We have covered a lot of ground about Support vector machine algorithm, its working, kernels, Hyperparameters tuning, model building and evaluation on Breast Cancer Dataset using the Scikit-learn package.
